# Extend React Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can learn more in the [CRA documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Setup

- Inside this folder run `yarn` and then `yarn start` and `yarn test`, [help setting up yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
- CRA requires `Node 14.0.0 or later version`, instructions to [change your node version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53785383/how-to-change-node-version-with-nvm/53785482).
- Create a new private repo on Github and follow the instructions to [push your local code to your remote repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository).
- Check out a new branch locally to complete the challenge
- When you are ready, push that branch and open a PR
- Add `funador` as a collaborator on your private repo
- Any questions or ready for a review? Please send an email to `jesse@extend.com`
- If you prefer JavaScript, use the JavaScript branch in this repo as your starter.

## Challenge

- Follow the instructions in App.tsx
- Use any packages that you want
- Style the UI however you want
